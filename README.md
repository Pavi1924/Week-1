# 👗 Sustainable Fashion Assistant – AI + AR + Voice-Powered App

### 🧠 About the Project
The *Sustainable Fashion Assistant* is an intelligent Java-based application designed to promote *sustainability and accessibility* in the fashion industry.  
This app helps users identify fabric types, detect defects in clothes, get weather-based outfit suggestions, and discover eco-friendly alternatives.  
It also features an *AR-based virtual try-on* and *voice assistant* support to ensure inclusivity for visually impaired users.

### 🚀 Features
- 🧵 *Fabric Classification:* Identifies fabric type (cotton, silk, denim, etc.) using CNN.
- ⚠ *Defect Detection:* Detects flaws like stains, tears, or weaving errors in the cloth.
- ☁ *Weather-Based Recommendation:* Suggests suitable clothing according to live weather data.
- 🌱 *Sustainability Insight:* Recommends eco-friendly or alternative materials.
- 🗣 *Voice Assistant:* Enables hands-free interaction for visually impaired users.
- 👚 *AR-Based Try-On:* Lets users visualize how the outfit looks using AR technology.

### 🧩 Problem Statement
Consumers and designers struggle to make *sustainable and informed fashion choices* due to a lack of intelligent, accessible tools.  
Visually impaired individuals face further challenges in identifying fabric types or detecting defects.  
This project proposes an *AI-powered sustainable fashion assistant* that leverages *CNN, AR, and voice assistance* to simplify clothing decisions, ensure inclusivity, and promote eco-friendly fashion practices.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Build a CNN model for fabric and defect detection.
- Integrate AR for real-time virtual try-on.
- Use weather data to suggest daily outfit recommendations.
- Enable voice accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Promote sustainability by recommending eco-friendly materials.

### 🧠 Model Workflow
1. User uploads or captures a photo of the fabric.
2. CNN model predicts fabric type and checks for defects.
3. Weather API retrieves current weather data.
4. App recommends sustainable, weather-friendly clothing options.
5. Voice assistant announces the results for accessibility.
6. AR module allows users to visualize the outfit virtually.
